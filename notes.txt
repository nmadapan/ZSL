Paper plan:
Intro:
	* Why zero-shot and few-shot
	* Why it is relevant for temporal problems such as gestures 
	* Lack of unified frameworks
	* Contributions:
		- unified framework
		- deep algorithm (internal thresholding and classification technique to improve GZSL)
		- rigorous experiments on gestures dataset

TODO: Cite some papers related to unified frameworks and gzsl, and action recognition (). 
Previous work:
	* ZSL
	* FSL
	* ZSL for temporal problems

Methods:
	* Combine RQ 1 and 2. 

Experiments and results:
	* FSL 
	* ZSL
	* GZSL
	- four approaches (DAP, IAP, ESZSL, SAE, JSSE)
	- five splits
	ROC, AUC plots in each setting. 

## TODO
* Organize the code well. Work on the design so that:
	- easy to do hyper parameter tuning
	- easy to play with different loss functions
	- create a bunch of loss functions: eszsl, sae, cross entropy, mse, etc. Be consistent b/w sd and class predictions. 
* Check the following:
	1. find the sd pdf of seen classes. find the sd pdf of unseen classes. Check if they are significantly different. Ideally they should not be significantly different. If they are not significantly different, the cross validation splits with completely different pdf can be eliminated right here. 
	2. Check if the model is always predicting a particular unseen class. that would mean we need to fix the knn part after sd prediction. Print the confusion matrix to see what is happening. 
* Generate custom features for each set of four frames ==> 40 frames would effectively give 10 frames but each frame is represented by a custom feature vector. 
* GRU

## Next 2 days
* Get Attention LSTM, 3DConvLSTM, C3D networks working. 
* Integrate these networks with SD loss and stuff. 

## Misc
Make the attribute dataset without baselines - finish that repository.

#### Other Ideas ####
#####################
* Combine the idea of zsl with siamese-like networks with triplet losses. 
* Explore attention ZSL to see how it works. and may other baselines. 

* Random forest equivalent of temporal zsl based on attributes. randomly select K attributes and average out results.

#####################
#### BLSTM Ideas ####
#####################
* Use the forward representation to learn the given SD vector. 
* Use the backward representation to learn the opposite of SD vector (switch directional motion ids).
* Attribute based data augmentation. 
* Use element-wise scaled hyperbolic tangent function instead of regular tanh.

#####################
#### ZSL Library ####
#####################
We want to have stand alone classes for each ZSL method. 
We should be able to combine it with scalers in sklearn, kernel methods in sklearn using ZSLPipeline. 
We should be able tune this combination using ZSLGridSearchCV.
